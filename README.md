# Titanic Kaggle Competition

This is my submission for the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic ). 

I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to build a Random Forest classifier that predicted whether passengers survived based on available features and based on trained data.

--> Analyzed passenger survival data using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) in Jupyter Notebook.
--> Performed exploratory data analysis, handled missing values, and engineered features.
--> Trained a Random Forest classifier achieving 80% validation accuracy.
--> Submitted final predictions to the public leaderboard.

## What's inside:
